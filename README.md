# Bruno's Personal Setup

A [tech pack](https://github.com/bguidolim/mcs) that turns Claude Code into a **self-improving iOS development environment** — with persistent memory, semantic code navigation, Xcode integration, and opinionated git workflows.

Built for the [`mcs`](https://github.com/bguidolim/mcs) configuration engine.

## What Is This?

[`mcs`](https://github.com/bguidolim/mcs) is a configuration engine for Claude Code — think Terraform for your AI coding environment. Instead of manually registering MCP servers, copying hook scripts, and editing settings for every project, you define everything in a **tech pack** and let the engine handle installation.

This tech pack packages a complete Claude Code setup: 4 MCP servers, 5 plugins, 4 session hooks, 2 slash commands, custom skills, per-project templates, and a **continuous learning system** that gives Claude long-term memory across sessions.

Tech packs are **composable** — `mcs` can apply multiple packs to the same project, and packs can declare peer dependencies on each other. This setup could easily be split into a general-purpose Core pack and a separate iOS pack. Since it's a personal setup, I chose to keep everything in one place for simplicity.

## Continuous Learning — The Core Feature

### The Problem

Claude Code has no memory between sessions. Every conversation starts from zero — solutions discovered yesterday, architecture decisions made last week, debugging breakthroughs from last month — all gone. You end up re-explaining the same context, re-discovering the same workarounds, and re-making the same decisions.

### The Solution

This pack implements a **closed-loop knowledge system** that captures valuable insights during work and resurfaces them automatically when they're relevant again.

```
                              CONTINUOUS LEARNING LOOP

```

### The Four Pieces

| Piece | What | How |
|-------|------|-----|
| **Activator Hook** | Triggers evaluation after every prompt | A `PreToolUse` hook reminds Claude to check if the current task produced extractable knowledge |
| **Continuous Learning Skill** | Structures and saves knowledge | A Claude Code skill with extraction rules, quality gates, naming conventions, and ADR-inspired templates |
| **Memory Files** | Persistent storage | Structured markdown files in `.claude/memories/` — version-controlled, human-readable, editable |
| **Semantic Search** | Retrieval at session start | `docs-mcp-server` + Ollama embeddings index memory files and serve them via natural-language search |

### Memory Types

The system captures two categories of knowledge:

**Learnings** — non-obvious discoveries from debugging and investigation:
```
.claude/memories/learning_swiftui_task_cancellation_on_view_dismiss.md
.claude/memories/learning_core_data_batch_insert_memory_spike.md
.claude/memories/learning_xcode_preview_crash_missing_environment.md
```

Each learning follows a structured template: **Problem → Trigger Conditions → Solution → Verification → Example → Notes → References**.

**Decisions** — deliberate architectural and convention choices:
```
.claude/memories/decision_architecture_mvvm_coordinators.md
.claude/memories/decision_testing_snapshot_strategy.md
.claude/memories/decision_codestyle_naming_conventions.md
```

Decisions use an ADR-inspired template: **Decision → Context → Options Considered → Choice → Consequences → Scope → Examples**.

### The Feedback Loop in Practice

1. **Session starts** → the Ollama status hook detects `.claude/memories/` and re-indexes all memory files into a vector store using `nomic-embed-text` embeddings (runs in the background, doesn't block the session)

2. **Before any task** → a `CLAUDE.local.md` instruction tells Claude to search the knowledge base first (`search_docs` with the project name), surfacing relevant past learnings and decisions

3. **During work** → the activator hook fires on every prompt, reminding Claude to evaluate whether the current interaction produced knowledge worth saving

4. **After valuable work** → the continuous learning skill extracts structured memories, checks for duplicates against the existing KB, and writes them to `.claude/memories/`

5. **Next session** → the new memories are indexed, and the loop continues

Over time, the project accumulates a searchable knowledge base that makes Claude increasingly effective — debugging patterns don't need to be rediscovered, architectural decisions don't need to be re-justified, and conventions don't need to be re-explained.

## Session Lifecycle

When you start a Claude Code session in a project configured with this pack, here's what happens before you type a single prompt:

```
claude                           ← you start a session
  │
  ├─ SessionStart hooks fire:
  │   ├─ session_start.sh        → "Branch: feature/login, ⬆️ 2 commits ahead, 🔀 Open PR #42"
  │   ├─ ollama-status.sh        → "🦙 Ollama: running" + background re-index of memories
  │   └─ ios-simulator-status.sh → "Booted Simulator: iPhone 16 Pro [UUID]"
  │
  ├─ CLAUDE.local.md loads:
  │   ├─ "Search the KB before any task"
  │   ├─ "Use Serena for Swift files"
  │   ├─ "Use XcodeBuildMCP for builds"
  │   └─ "Branch naming: feature/{ticket}-description"
  │
  └─ Claude is now context-aware, memory-equipped, and ready to work
```

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- macOS (Apple Silicon or Intel)
- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) CLI
- Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`)

### Setup

```bash
# 1. Install mcs
brew install bguidolim/tap/my-claude-setup

# 2. Register this tech pack
mcs pack add https://github.com/bguidolim/mcs-personal-setup

# 3. Sync your project
cd ~/Developer/my-ios-project
mcs sync

# 4. Verify everything is healthy
mcs doctor
```

During `mcs sync`, you'll be prompted for:

| Prompt | What It Does | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Xcode project** | Auto-detects `*.xcodeproj` / `*.xcworkspace` files for XcodeBuildMCP | *(detected)* |
| **Branch prefix** | Sets git branch naming convention (e.g. `feature/ABC-123-login`) | `feature` |

## Customization

You don't need to install everything. Run `mcs sync --customize` and select only the components you want — skip the iOS tooling, pick just the continuous learning system, or mix and match.

For deeper changes, fork the pack and make it yours:

1. **Fork** this repository
2. **Edit** `techpack.yaml` — add or remove components, change identifiers
3. **Modify** templates, hooks, or skills to match your workflow
4. **Register** your fork: `mcs pack add https://github.com/you/your-fork`

The `techpack.yaml` schema is documented in the [MCS tech pack schema reference](https://github.com/bguidolim/mcs/blob/main/docs/techpack-schema.md).
