# Continuous Learning

A [tech pack](https://github.com/bguidolim/mcs) that gives Claude Code **persistent memory across sessions** — capturing debugging discoveries, architectural decisions, and project conventions into a searchable knowledge base that makes Claude increasingly effective over time.

Built for the [`mcs`](https://github.com/bguidolim/mcs) configuration engine.

## The Problem

Claude Code has no memory between sessions. Every conversation starts from zero — solutions discovered yesterday, architecture decisions made last week, debugging breakthroughs from last month — all gone. You end up re-explaining the same context, re-discovering the same workarounds, and re-making the same decisions.

## The Solution

This pack implements a **closed-loop knowledge system** that captures valuable insights during work and resurfaces them automatically when they're relevant again.

```
                              CONTINUOUS LEARNING LOOP

## How It Works

### The Four Pieces

| Piece | What | How |
|-------|------|-----|
| **Activator Hook** | Triggers evaluation after every prompt | A `PreToolUse` hook reminds Claude to check if the current task produced extractable knowledge |
| **Continuous Learning Skill** | Structures and saves knowledge | A Claude Code skill with extraction rules, quality gates, naming conventions, and ADR-inspired templates |
| **Memory Files** | Persistent storage | Structured markdown files in `.claude/memories/` — version-controlled, human-readable, editable |
| **Semantic Search** | Retrieval at session start | `docs-mcp-server` + Ollama embeddings index memory files and serve them via natural-language search |

### The Feedback Loop

1. **Session starts** — the Ollama status hook detects `.claude/memories/` and re-indexes all memory files into a vector store using `nomic-embed-text` embeddings (runs in the background, doesn't block the session)

2. **Before any task** — a `CLAUDE.local.md` instruction tells Claude to search the knowledge base first (`search_docs` with the project name), surfacing relevant past learnings and decisions

3. **During work** — the activator hook fires on every prompt, reminding Claude to evaluate whether the current interaction produced knowledge worth saving

4. **After valuable work** — the continuous learning skill extracts structured memories, checks for duplicates against the existing KB, and writes them to `.claude/memories/`

5. **Next session** — the new memories are indexed, and the loop continues

Over time, the project accumulates a searchable knowledge base that makes Claude increasingly effective — debugging patterns don't need to be rediscovered, architectural decisions don't need to be re-justified, and conventions don't need to be re-explained.

## Memory Types

The system captures two categories of knowledge:

**Learnings** — non-obvious discoveries from debugging and investigation:
```
.claude/memories/learning_swiftui_task_cancellation_on_view_dismiss.md
.claude/memories/learning_core_data_batch_insert_memory_spike.md
.claude/memories/learning_xcode_preview_crash_missing_environment.md
```

Each learning follows a structured template: **Problem > Trigger Conditions > Solution > Verification > Example > Notes > References**.

**Decisions** — deliberate architectural and convention choices:
```
.claude/memories/decision_architecture_mvvm_coordinators.md
.claude/memories/decision_testing_snapshot_strategy.md
.claude/memories/decision_codestyle_naming_conventions.md
```

Decisions use an ADR-inspired template: **Decision > Context > Options Considered > Choice > Consequences > Scope > Examples**.
