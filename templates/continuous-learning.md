## MANDATORY — Before Starting Any Task

Before writing code, planning, or exploring — **always search the knowledge base first**:

1. **Search the KB** — use the `docs-mcp-server` tools (`search_docs`) and set the `library` parameter to the name of the current project folder. The library name always matches the root directory name of this project. This server indexes `.claude/memories/` — it contains past learnings, debugging discoveries, and architectural decisions from previous sessions, not external documentation. Try multiple keyword variations if needed.
2. **Read matching memories** — review any relevant results for full context (architecture decisions, gotchas, patterns from past sessions).

Only after completing these steps should you proceed with discovery and implementation.
