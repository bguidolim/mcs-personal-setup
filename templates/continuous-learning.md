## MANDATORY — Before Starting Any Task

Before writing code, planning, or exploring — **always search the knowledge base first**:

1. **Search the KB** — call `search_docs` with library `__REPO_NAME__` and keywords relevant to the task. Try multiple keyword variations if needed.
2. **Read matching memories** — review any relevant results for full context (architecture decisions, gotchas, patterns from past sessions).

Only after these steps, proceed with discovery and implementation.
